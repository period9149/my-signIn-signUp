# my-sliding-login
A simple sliding web component for login and registration.

#### This is a simple sliding web component for login and registration. By using new features such as transition and transform in CSS3, build a smart login and registration page component.

Here are the main points:

 - Click the '登录' button to the sign in page.
 - Click the '注册' button to the sign up page.
 - When you click the button, there will be a wonderful sliding effect.
 - There will be a new user registration entry button, next to the login page.
 - There will be a login entry button for registered users, next to the registration page.
 
 #### The highlight of this component is that the login and registration pages are placed in a div and have a sliding effect that switches between them.
 
 Thanks for watching!
